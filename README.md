https://cprc.io content is mirrored here. 

I am a computer engineer focusing in security. The intent of cprc.io is to document my infosec journey, projects, thoughts, and be whatever else I decide it should be. I also plan to maintain curated lists of reading material, blogs, podcasts, and CTF sites. This repository will house the writings, lists, etc. featured on the site.
